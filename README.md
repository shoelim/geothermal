This repository contains a C++ program written for the numerical simulation of two-phase heat flow and
transient partial melting in the lower crust. The details can be found in "physics_thesis.pdf". Some of the results were presented at the AGU Fall Meeting 2012 in San Francisco (with the title "Numerical Models of Transient Partial Melting of the Lower Crust during Repeated Emplacement of Basalt Sills and Subsequent Cooling due to Advection of Melt out of the Lower Crust"). 

Note: Makefile is available upon installation of deal.II at https://www.dealii.org/
